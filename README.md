## Overview

A bubbles visualisation for p5js. A fun way to represent quantitative data as set of bubbles
that grow, move and collide on the screen.

### Demos and Example Usage

Here are a couple of examples that you can use to understand how the visualisation looks:

* Click [here](https://pete-rai.github.io/p5js-bubbles/sample-bubbles.html?movies) to see an example based on _Top Grossing Movies_ (inflation adjusted)
* Click [here](https://pete-rai.github.io/p5js-bubbles/sample-bubbles.html?populations) to see an example based on _Country by Population_ (2016 figures)

do let me know by raising an issue [here](https://github.com/p5js-bubbles/pete-rai.github.io/issues). Better still, create a fix for the problem too and drop
in the changes; that way everyone can benefit from it.

### Dependencies

This plug relies on [p5js](https://p5js.org/) (version 0.5.8+)

## Example Usage

Its really easy to use the Bubbles visualisation in your own project. You just need to include the script (after the main p5js script) then declare one instance of the Bubbles class and point it to a dataset. The process is all documented below, or just take a look at one of the samples listed above.

### Declaring an Instance

In order to use this script, you *must* declare one instance of the Bubbles class in your code called 'bubbles' as shown below:

```html
 <script>
   var bubbles = new Bubbles ("mydata.json");
 </script>
```

or more fully:

```html
 <script>
   var bubbles = new Bubbles ("mydata.json", "hosting-control", onselect, tooltip);
 </script>
```

The parameters for the Bubbles class is as follows:

| Pos | Param | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | data-source | The URL for the JSON list of data items | See below for examples |
| 2 | parent-control | The ID of the hosting parent control | Set to _null_ to fill the whole HTML body |
| 3 | onselect&nbsp;(key,&nbsp;bubble) | The callback function for when a bubble is double-clicked | Set to _null_ for no action |
| 4 | tooltip&nbsp;(key,&nbsp;bubble) | The callback function to return the bubble tooltip | Set to _null_ for no tooltip |

### Source Data Format

The data returned from your data-source must be a JSON structure that (at least) has a "key", a "name" and a "count".
The "name" is what is displayed inside each bubble and the "count" governs the bubbles area:

```json
{
    "foo1": { "name": "bar1", "count": 1000    },
    "foo2": { "name": "bar2", "count":  750    },
    "foo3": { "name": "bar3", "count":  123.45 }
}
```

You can also include other data in the JSON. These won't be read by Bubbles, but will be passed to your callback functions on-select and tooltip. For example, the 'year' data item in the example below:

```json
{
    "Forrest_Gump"  : { "name": "Forrest Gump" , "count": 680016, "year": 1994 },
    "The_Godfather" : { "name": "The Godfather", "count": 682680, "year": 1972 },
    "Jurassic_Park" : { "name": "Jurassic Park", "count": 795124, "year": 1993 },
}
```

In these examples and the project samples, we only show static data. In a real system, you could dynamically generate your dataset by reading values of a backing store or database.

### Modifiable Constants

There are several constants at the top of the script, which you can modify in order to change the behaviour and appearance.

#### Fonts

The following constants control the font inside the bubbles:

| Constant | Default | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FONT_FACE | "Tahoma" | string | A browser safe font (btw Tahoma is a good choice as its quite narrow) |
| FONT_HEAD | 24 | point | The Size of page heading |
| FONT_MAX | 36 | point | The Largest allowed font |
| FONT_MIN | 8 | point | The Smallest allowed font |
| FONT_STEP | 2 | >=&nbsp;1 | The font size steps, from big to small |
| FONT_PAD | 8 | pixels | Some text padding within the bubble |

#### Colors

The following constants control the colors of various things:

| Constant | Default | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CLR_BACK | [230, 230, 250] | [r,g,b] | Background world color |
| CLR_TEXT | [  0, 102, 153] | [r,g,b] | Bubble text color |
| CLR_BALL | [250, 250, 250] | [r,g,b] | Background bubble color |
| CLR_HOVR | [100,   0,   0] | [r,g,b] | Hovered bubble text color |
| CLR_OVER | [255, 228, 225] | [r,g,b] | Hovered background bubble color |
| CLR_TIPS | [252, 240, 173] | [r,g,b] | Tooptip color |

#### Visuals

The following constants control factors that influence appearance:

| Constant | Default | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VIZ_WORLD_MARGIN | 10 | pixels | The margin around edge of the world that bubbles will bounce off |
| VIZ_RIM_FRACTION | 20 | >=&nbsp;1 | The fraction of each bubble that is the rim, bigger num = smaller rim |
| VIZ_DBL_CLICK | 500 | millsecs | The time window between which two clicks becomes a double click |
| VIZ_ALPHA_DEPTH | 0.60 | >0&nbsp;&&nbsp;<=1 | The depth of fading of small bubbles, bigger num = more fading |
| VIZ_CROWDEDNESS | 0.70 | >&nbsp;0 | How crowded the world space is, bigger = more crowded (0.78 = &Pi;/4 is the ratio area of square to circle, which is about optimal) |
| VIZ_FRAME_RATE | 50 | >1&nbsp;&&nbsp;<&nbsp;60 | The frame rate and hence smoothness of animation, bigger = smoother, but slower overall |
| VIZ_FONT_RECALC | 10 | >=&nbsp;1 | How much radius must change before a font recalculation (prevents font 'flickering') |

#### Tooltips

The following constants control the tooltip appearance:

| Constant | Default | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TIP_WANTED | true | bool | false = no tooltips at all |
| TIP_OFFSET | 15 | pixels | The tooltip offset from mouse |
| TIP_MARGIN | 4 | pixels | The tooltip margin |
| TIP_DELAY | 1500 | millsecs | The tooltip appearance delay |
| TIP_POINTSZ | 14 | point | The tooltip font point size |

#### Physics

The following constants control bubble movement and interaction (change with care):

| Constant | Default | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PHYS_REBOUND | 0.75 | 0.0&nbsp;to&nbsp;1.0 | The bounce velocity factor of hitting the world boundary |
| PHYS_FRICTION | 0.80 | 0.0&nbsp;to&nbsp;1.0 | The velocity drag of hitting the world boundary |
| PHYS_BIRTH_SPEED | 4.00 | >&nbsp;0.0 | The intial velocity for new bubbles |
| PHYS_REST_JIGGLE | 0.02 | >=&nbsp;0.0 | The restlessness for existing bubbles (zero means they will eventually come to rest) |

### Background

There is no need to understand the background maths and algorithms to use the bubbles visualisation, however for those who are interested I have detailed some aspects here.

#### Proportionality of Area

In the visualisation, the _area_ of the bubbles is in proportion to the data counts specified in the source data document. I've seen other similar works that scale the _radius_ instead. That is, of course, dead wrong - as it over emphases larger data counts. Given we are presenting our output in a 2D plane, then _area_ is clearly the right scaling domain. Similarly, if you do something like this on a VR headset, then you'd need to scale on volume.

![bubble scaling](https://github.com/pete-rai/p5js-bubbles/doc/scale.png)

As you can see in the diagram above, it's fairly easy to calculate the required radius given a fixed area.

#### Scaling and Crowdedness of Bubbles

How do we scale the bubbles for maximal effect? We start by looking at the largest count for all the elements in the source data. We then allocate that as 1000 'units'. We then scale every other element, in proportion to that 1000-unit largest bubble. Bubbles smaller than 1 (in this scale) are rounded up to 1 unit. These units are logical values only, on each draw we scale the units into the available screen real-estate.

So hence the bubbles are re-scaled on every frame tick. Why? So that it is maximally responsive to resolution changes. Shrink and grow the window whilst the visualisation is running to see the effect. The bubbles don't immediately grow to the end size; instead the source data is filtered-in, a frame tick at a time. This gives a more dynamic experience, allowing the bubbles to slowly take on their end sizes.

In order to scale to available screen real-estate, we start by calculating the available space and then we factor by a 'crowdedness' scalar. The high this scalar, the more 'bunched up' the bubbles will be. The optimal value for this is pretty much the ratio of the area of a circle to its circumscribed square (&pi; / 4 - see below). Essentially handling the difficulties in tessellating circles as opposed to tessellating squares.

![circumscribed square](https://github.com/pete-rai/p5js-bubbles/doc/crowdedness.png)

You can change the 'crowdedness' scalar as itâ€™s just a constant at the top of the file. Generally, the bigger your screen real-estate, the more you will need to play around with this value to get best results.

#### Collisions of Bubbles

Collisions are always fun! On every frame tick we check if any bubble has collided with any other bubble, using the technique below:

![collisions](https://github.com/pete-rai/p5js-bubbles/doc/collide.png)

This is also the code that gets executed when you drag a bubble around and it bumps into others and pushes them away. It amazing that this high-school trig can lead to such realistic feeling movement. There is some deeper truth in that.

#### Fitting Text Inside Circles

Buried in this script is a neat way to optimise the fitting of text within a circle with the largest font.

In order to make life easier, we start by finding the _inscribed square_ within the circle; then we find the largest text that fits within that square.

![line break combinations](https://github.com/pete-rai/p5js-bubbles/doc/clauses.png)

Why the inscribed square? Why not the radius of the circle? Well the radius it a more tempting space, as it larger - but it's only better for the horizontal and vertical lateral. In the diagonals, the text could well 'poke out' the bounds of the circle if we just use the radius. In fact, using the radius is the same as using the _circumscribed square_ (as described earlier when we spoke about crowdedness). In fact, using square at all it a shortcut. If you are better than me at geometry, please do have a go treating the text bounds as the true circular circumference.

Now we have the bounding box, we work out all the ways we can line break the phrases to fit into the box (in the code these are call clauses).

![inscribed square](https://github.com/pete-rai/p5js-bubbles/doc/inscribed.png)

As you can see in the code, the best way to get the full list of line broken strings is to use a recursive function. So finally, we brute force all the phrases, for all the fonts to find the one that fills the bounding box with the greatest area. Thatâ€™s expensive (text width measuring costs many machine cycles), but there is a simple cache so that it is only done once per bubble.
